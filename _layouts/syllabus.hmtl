      <h1>Stopping by for a chat, AKA "office hours"</h1>
      <p>
      I am typically in my office, {{ site.office }}, or in the CSci labs (Sci 2610, 2630, and 2650)
      during the day, and you're always more than welcome to come track me down, or e-mail
      me ({{ site.email }}) or call me ({{ site.office_phone }}) to make an appointment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I use <a href="{{ site.calendar_url }}">the U's Google Calendar</a>
        to manage my calendar and it's
        <em>totally</em> fine to use it to see where I might be, see when I'm
        free, or <em>just make an appointment</em>. If you add an appointment
        to my calendar (presumably in a spot when I appear free), I'll get an
        e-mail about it. If it looks like that time will work I'll accept the
        appointment; otherwise I'll mail you back suggesting an alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
      My "official" office hours this semester are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        {% for term in site.data.office_hours %}
          {% if term.semester == page.semester and term.year == page.year  %}
            {% for slot in term.times %}
              <li>{{ slot }}</li>
            {% else %}
              <li>To be determined</li>
            {% endfor %}
          {% endif %}
        {% endfor %}
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="contact">
      <h1>How to best get in touch and my contact info</h1>
      <p>
      The best way to contact me is probably e-mail ({{ site.email }}), although
      if you really need to get my attention and I'm looking swamped (an all too
      common occurrence, I'm afraid) then your best bets are probably:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Showing up at my office ({{ site.office }}, {{ office_location }}).</li>
        <li>Poke me via Google Hangouts ({{ site.email }}); this is particularly
        nice if you're in the lab and want to find out if I'm around before you
        trek down to my office.</li>
        <li>Call my office ({{ site.office_phone }}).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Academic dishonesty</h2>
      <p>
        Academic dishonesty in any portion of the academic work for a course shall be grounds for awarding a grade of F or N for the entire course.

    <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>

<p>Academic integrity is essential to a positive teaching and learning
environment. All students enrolled in University courses are expected to
complete coursework responsibilities with fairness and honesty. Failure
to do so by seeking unfair advantage over others or misrepresenting
someone else's work as your own, can result in disciplinary action. <a href="http://regents.umn.edu/sites/regents.umn.edu/files/policies/Student_Conduct_Code.pdf">The
University Student Conduct Code</a> defines scholastic dishonesty as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>Scholastic dishonesty means plagiarism; cheating on assignments or examinations; engaging in unauthorized collaboration on academic work; taking, acquiring, or using  test materials without faculty permission; submitting false or incomplete records of academic achievement; acting alone or in cooperation with another to falsify records or to obtain dishonestly grades, honors, awards, or professional endorsement; altering, forging, misrepresenting, or misusing a University academic record; or fabricating or falsifying data, research procedures, or data analysis.</p></blockquote>

<p>Within this course, a student responsible for scholastic dishonesty can
be assigned a penalty up to and including an "F" or "N" for the course.
If you have any questions regarding the expectations for a specific
assignment or exam, ask.</p>

<h2>Final words</h2>

<ul>
<li>Policy is subject to change, but only with advanced warning given in
class suitably far in advance.</li>
<li>Major changes are unexpected.</li>
<li>It is University policy to provide reasonable accommodations to
students with disabilities. This publication/material is available
in alternative formats to persons with disabilities upon request.
Please contact the Disability Services office, 589-6163, Room 362
Briggs Library to discuss accommodation needs.</li>
<li>University policy prohibits sexual harassment as defined by the
University of Minnesota Regents' policy:
<a href="http://regents.umn.edu/sites/regents.umn.edu/files/policies/SexHarassment.pdf">http://regents.umn.edu/sites/regents.umn.edu/files/policies/SexHarassment.pdf</a></li>
<li>Additional relevant university-wide policies  may be found
online: <a href="http://policy.umn.edu/Policies/Education/Education/SYLLABUSREQUIREMENTS_APPA.html">http://policy.umn.edu/Policies/Education/Education/SYLLABUSREQUIREMENTS_APPA.html</a>.</li>
<li>You should work together whenever possible, but the act of copying
or other forms of cheating will not be tolerated. Academic
dishonesty in any portion of the academic work for a course is
grounds for awarding a grade of F or N for the entire course. Any
act of plagiarism that is detected will result in a mark of zero on
the entire test or assignment for both parties. Please come and talk to me if you
have any questions about what constitutes academic dishonesty. UMM's
Academic Integrity policy and procedures can be found at the
following website: Academic Integrity
<a href="http://committees.morris.umn.edu/academic-integrity">http://committees.morris.umn.edu/academic-integrity</a></li>
<li>As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause
barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased
anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty
concentrating, and/or lack of motivation. These mental health
concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic
performance or reduce your ability to participate in
daily activities. If you have any special needs or requirements to
help you succeed in the class, come and talk to me as soon as
possible, or visit the appropriate University service yourself. You
can learn more about the range of services available on campus by
