description: Model-based study of computing systems, operating systems, and networks. Discussion of modularity and organization, protection and security, performance, memory management and data storage, deadlock, and inter-process and inter-computer communication.
notes: I'm going to try to not change a whole lot this year since KK will be teaching it next year when I'm on sabbatical, and I want it to stay pretty much the same as when we taught it together last year. It would be nice to improve the Arduino labs, though, since I still don't think we have a good handle on those.
