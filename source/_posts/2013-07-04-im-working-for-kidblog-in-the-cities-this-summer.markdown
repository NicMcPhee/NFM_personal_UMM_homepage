{" "I got a summer job!" "} Words you might expect to hear from one of my students, but less likely from me. For over a decade, though, I've been talking about possibly getting a summer gig programming in the "real world". It's been decades since I programmed for a living, and the field has changed enormously (e.g., there was no web then). I talk all the time in classes about programming "out there", and while I read lots of the cool kids and try to keep up with alums about their lives and work experiences, it's hard to not feel a bit like a poseur at times.

So, with our son done with high school and out east at college, now seemed like a good time to explore this possibility. I contacted several alums in the Cities, and in the end found a home working with the crew at [Kidblog.org](http://kidblog.org). The founders (Matt Hardy & Dan Flies) are two UMM CSci alums from the early '00s and have manage to build an splendid blogging platform for K-8 teachers and their students, hosting over a quarter of a million classes with over 3 million users. As the system has grown, Dan & Matt were able to raise enough VC funding to focus full-time on Kidblog, and even hire a few other people (like me!) to help with a major rewrite. The legacy system has been an increasingly complex (and hard to maintain) WordPress mod, and we're in the final stages of a complete rewrite.

My main contribution so far has been working with Ted Cushman (Chief Architect) on the server side, which is written in Clojure and Java. I do things like add new API REST endpoints that the client (which Matt & Dan are writing in Angular & Javascript) can access to get things like all the comments on posts in a student's portfolio. I also ask Ted a _lot_ of questions, so I particularly appreciate his patience and help in getting me up to speed on a complex system.

It's been a great experience and I'm really grateful for the opportunity to be working with such cool people on a project that clearly means a _ton_ to a lot of teachers (and parents) out there. It's also neat that we're working with fairly cutting edge/modern tools so I'm picking up a bunch of neat experience that I can bring back to the classroom in August.

They did [a nice little write up](http://kidblog.org/home/the-internship/) on their blog a few weeks back, complete with a picture with the Guthrie Theatre and mill district in the background.
