## Nic McPhee's personal "home page" at UMM

The contents and build process for [my personal homepage](http://www.morris.umn.edu/~mcphee) at the [University of Minnesota, Morris](http://www.morris.umn.edu/).
I've been just hacking raw HTML since creating the page in the mid-90's, and the time has long since come for me
to move to a more modern setup.

The current plan is to use [Octopress](http://octopress.org) (based on [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll))
to manage the content.
